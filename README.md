# My Super Awesome Music Mixer Project
In its First state, the puzzle game has at least a couple of bugs.First error( solved in the branch- dev.mpj.swaperror) You can drag and drop
more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone - this breaks things. There should only be
one piece in one drop zone at a time.
The second bug is ( solved in the branch- dev.mpj.resetimage) the problem with pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset. Removed all of them, so that the player have a fresh board to drop onto.
